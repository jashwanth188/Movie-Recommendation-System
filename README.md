# Movie-Recommendation-System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using machine learning techniques. It analyzes a user's preferences and recommends similar movies based on their ratings or selected genres. The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods.

## Features

- Collaborative filtering: Recommends movies based on user behavior (ratings).
- Content-based filtering: Recommends movies similar to a selected one based on metadata.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning and recommendation algorithms.
- Pandas and NumPy for data handling.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- The necessary libraries can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movierecommendation.git
   cd movierecommendation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Use the following command to install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

   Start Jupyter Notebook and open the `Movie Recommendation System.ipynb`:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Dataset**:

   If your project uses an external dataset, make sure to add the dataset file in the repository or provide a link for the dataset download. Modify the dataset path in the notebook accordingly.

## Usage

- Open the `Movie Recommendation System.ipynb` file and run the cells sequentially.
- You will get personalized movie recommendations based on the dataset and the algorithm chosen.
